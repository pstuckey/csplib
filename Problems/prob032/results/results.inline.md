### Known Solutions

Bob Bosch and Mike Trick have found optimal solutions up to 14 x 14.  For some larger 
sizes, the optimal solutions with some kind of symmetry are known:  for instance, 
optimal rotationally symmetric and bilaterally symmetric solutions have been found for 
the 18 x 18 problem. As far as I am aware, larger optimal solutions are not currently 
known (January 2002). 

### Problem Closed

The problem was shown to have a closed form solution by Geoffrey Chu and Peter J. Stuckey. 
They built a model for the problem which is much easier to solve since its counts missed opportunities to place a live cell. This allows solving of problems up to size 50. They define a boundary relaxation of the problem which is tight for large n, and a special search approach that concentrates on the boundary relaxation. That allows the solution of problems up to size 200. They then show that there are periodicy constraints that allow us to tile parts of a solution to create larger solutions, this allows the solution for all n.
